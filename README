Requirements:

- Twisted
- Cerealizer

To play you'll need to connect to a server. You can start one by running:

    rounder-server

This will spawn a server with one or two limit holdem tables. The server will
be listening on port 35100, and if this port is accessible to the internet you
can invite friends to connect and play as well.

To start playing just run:

    rounder

And enter the appropriate server information and a username of your choice.
WARNING: At this point in time account creation isn't implemented. You can
choose any login name you want, but you *MUST* use the password 'password'.
Future releases will obviously correct this.

If you're feeling lonely and would like a really unintelligent bot to play
against, just run:

   rounder-randombot --host localhost --port 35100 -u bot0 -p password
