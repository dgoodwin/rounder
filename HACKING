Want to hack on Rounder? Here's everything you should need to know.

=============
GENERAL NOTES
=============

We'll do everything in our power to get contributed patches into the codebase.
We're attempting to keep the code as clean, logical, and maintainable as
possible, so in the event a patch is received which we don't understand or
feel violates any of the above, we may modify it, ask for a re-submit, or just
start a dialog to help determine what to do. Goal is to be as community
friendly as possible while still maintaining a stable code base. If you spot
something in the code you feel violates any of the above, please feel free to
bring it to up, preferably with suggestions for improvement.

In general, all code should adhere to the Python code style defined in PEP 8:

    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Rounder should never have to be 'installed' to be developed against. Most
everything should be runnable from the base source directory assuming the
developer has the required dependencies installed.

Unit tests are rounder's lifeblood. Virtually everything short of the client
code is unit tested and when working with a dynamic language this is extremely
important for allowing us to refactor problem areas down the road. Tests
included in the default suite must be "pure" and lightning fast, no disk
access, no network access, and test the components as fine grained as
possible.

============
ARCHITECTURE
============

See the doc sub-directory. (COMING SOON)

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Rounder currently has the following dependencies: (NOTE: these must currently
be manually installed until we have packages and distutils setup properly)

* Twisted: http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
Python Network library used for all of Rounder's networking.

* Cerealizer: http://home.gna.org/oomadness/en/cerealizer/index.html
Python module for serializing objects for transmission. Used instead of
Twisted's capabilities which didn't seem to actually do much of the heavy
lifting for you.

* PyPokerEval: http://pokersource.sourceforge.net/
Part of the Poker Source project, this will hopefully be removed as a
dependency someday. It depends on C code which is going to pose nothing but
problems particularly if Rounder is ever to run on Windows. Using for hand
ranking only temporarily.

============
RUNNNG TESTS
============

From the root of the source directory:

    ./runtests.py               Runs all the pure unit tests. (very fast)
