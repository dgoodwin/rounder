============
RUNNNG TESTS
============

From the root of the source directory:

./runtests.py               Runs all the pure unit tests. (very fast)
./runnetworktests.py        Runs the network tests. Requires that the test
                            sever be started. (./starttestserver.py)

=============
GENERAL NOTES
=============

Rounder should never have to be 'installed' to be developed against. Most
everything should be runnable from the base source directory.

Unit test everything you possibly can. Keep tests pure if included in the
default alltests.py, no disk/network access or persistent changes. If need
arises for non-unit tests we'll setup infrastructure for a separate more time
consuming suite, but avoid this whenever possible.
