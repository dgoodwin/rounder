============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Rounder currently has the following dependencies:

* Twisted: http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
Python Network library used for all of Rounder's networking.

* Cerealizer: http://home.gna.org/oomadness/en/cerealizer/index.html
Python module for serializing objects for transmission. Used instead of
Twisted's capabilities which didn't seem to actually do much of the heavy
lifting for you.

* PyPokerEval: http://pokersource.sourceforge.net/
Part of the Poker Source project, this will hopefully be removed as a
dependency someday. It depends on C code which is going to pose nothing but
problems particularly if Rounder is ever to run on Windows. Using for hand
ranking only temporarily.

============
RUNNNG TESTS
============

From the root of the source directory:

    ./runtests.py               Runs all the pure unit tests. (very fast)

To test the network using dummy clients that just randomly choose an action:
NOTE: this is somewhat outdated and may no longer work. Most of this is now
tested in the standard unit tests.

    ./rounder-server
    ./rounder-testclient -u player0 -p password
    ./rounder-testclient -u player1 -p password -i

    NOTE: more test clients can be created, just add -i to the last one. 
    The server currently is configured for several playerX logins and 
    passwords as above.

=============
GENERAL NOTES
=============

Rounder should never have to be 'installed' to be developed against. Most
everything should be runnable from the base source directory.

Unit test everything you possibly can. Keep tests pure if included in the
default alltests.py, no disk/network access or persistent changes. If need
arises for non-unit tests we'll setup infrastructure for a separate more time
consuming suite, but avoid this whenever possible.
